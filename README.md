# solar-rover-comminication-channel-gui
the designed gui allows to show temperature,humidity like physical value and decide robot 

Solar rover can measure temperature, humidity, pressure with appropriate sensors in real time. In this project, we have temperature and humidity sensor. To be observed envrenment ip camera is added. Thus, camera IP can be typed everytime. Also, the camera can be converted to leftward or rightward via servo motor. These are designed in one user interface manupulating robot and shows the physical value to analyze envirenment from far away. So, comminication can be handled via bluetooth module, XBee module or radio module. In this project bluetooth module was used because it is cheapest and easy to use with computer.

Here is user interface designed for mini solar rover.
